# Service Discovery with Eureka and Spring Boot.  

## Eureka Service Registry

- `` eureka-service-registry-application`` contains the service registry implementation for this use case. 
- This spring boot application leverage Spring Cloudâ€™s  ``@EnableEurekaServer`` annotation. This is a Spring Boot application with one annotation added to enable the service registry.
- You can run this applicaiton with `` mvn spring-boot:run`` inside the application directory. 

## Registering services 

- You can connect to Eureka service registry and register any Spring Boot application with it. 
- `` eureka-service-registration`` application registers with Eureka Service Registry. 
- `` @EnableDiscoveryClient`` annotation that we have at the Spring Boot application makes sure that the appliction is registered with the Eureka Registry. The name of the application is 
picked from `` spring.application.name`` property in `` bootstrap.properties`` file (here we use ``hello-service`` as the name of the service). 
- The details of the Eureka server that you connect with is configured in `` resources/application.yml `` with the following configuration.

    ```
    eureka:
    client:
        serviceUrl:
        defaultZone: http://localhost:8762/eureka/ 

    ```


- You can run this applicaiton with `` mvn spring-boot:run`` inside the application directory. 

## Discovering services 
- You can discover the service information by querying the service registry. `` eureka-service-discovery`` application queries the 
service registry by using the Spring Cloud `` DiscoveryClient `` abstraction to interrogate the registry for service's host and port. 
- You can run this applicaiton with `` mvn spring-boot:run`` inside the application directory. 

## Invoking discover service

- You can invoke the service which can discover service information, by sending a HTTP Get request to `` curl http://localhost:9090/service-instances/hello-service
``
- This service will return the service metadata of the requested service which is retrieved from the Eureka service registry.

```

- Now you can try invoking the service endpoint of the service that you retrieved from the discovering service. 

```  curl http://localhost:9090/service-instances/hello-service ```
